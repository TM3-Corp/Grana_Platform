# üöÄ Smart Search - Quick Start Guide

## What Is It?

Intelligent fuzzy product search that finds products across all your sales channels (Shopify, MercadoLibre, Manual) even when they have different names.

**Example**: Search "barrita keto" and find both:
- Shopify: "Barra Keto Nuez"
- MercadoLibre: "Barrita Keto Nuez 5 Unidades"

### How to Use

1. **Go to Products Page**: `/dashboard/products`

2. **Type your search**: Examples:
   - `keto nuez` - Find keto products with nuts
   - `barrita` - Find all bar products
   - `BARR-KETO-01` - Search by SKU
   - `low carb chocolate` - Multi-word search

3. **Use Suggestions**: Click on suggestion chips that appear:
   - üí° **Did you mean**: Try similar terms
   - üè∑Ô∏è **Filter**: Show only one category
   - üîó **Related**: Discover related products

4. **Click Results**: Yellow highlights show where your search matched

5. **Clear Search**: Click "Limpiar b√∫squeda" to return to normal view

### Tips

‚úÖ **Spelling doesn't matter**: "queto" finds "keto"
‚úÖ **Word order doesn't matter**: "nuez keto" = "keto nuez"
‚úÖ **Variations work**: "barra", "barrita", "barritas" all work
‚úÖ **Try suggestions**: They're designed to help you find what you need

### Quick Implementation

```typescript

function MyPage({ products }) {
  const { search, searchQuery, setSearchQuery, suggestions } = useSmartSearch(products)
  const results = search(searchQuery)

  return (
    <>
      <SmartSearchBar
        value={searchQuery}
        onChange={setSearchQuery}
        suggestions={suggestions}
      />
      {results.map(r => <div key={r.product.id}>{r.product.name}</div>)}
    </>
  )
}
```

### Run Tests

```bash
# Setup (first time only)
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom

# Run tests
npm test

# See test documentation
cat __tests__/README.md
```

### Customize Search

**Add new term variations** (`lib/searchConfig.ts`):
```typescript
export const termVariations = {
  // Add your variations
  'energia': ['energia', 'energetica', 'energ√©tico'],
}
```

**Adjust sensitivity** (`lib/searchConfig.ts`):
```typescript
export const fuseOptions = {
  threshold: 0.5,  // Lower = more strict, Higher = more lenient
  distance: 150,   // Max characters to search
}
```

## Common Issues

### "No results found"

**If searching for existing product**:
1. Check product is loaded: Open browser console, check Network tab
2. Try variations: "barra" instead of "barrita"
3. Check spelling: "keto" not "queto" (though typos should work)

**If product really doesn't exist**:
- This is expected behavior
- Check Analytics dashboard for common "no results" searches
- Consider adding those products to catalog

### "Search is slow"

**If >500 products**:
- Consider server-side search
- See `SMART_SEARCH_GUIDE.md` for scaling recommendations

**If <500 products**:
- Check browser DevTools Performance tab
- Look for other performance issues on page
- Ensure products are memoized: `useMemo(() => products, [products])`

### "Analytics not updating"

**Check**:
1. Analytics tracking is called: `useSearchAnalytics()`
2. LocalStorage enabled: Check browser settings
3. API endpoints working: `/api/v1/products/search/track`
